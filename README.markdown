# Ghetto Birds Code #
This is the source code and art for the 'Ghetto Birds' presentation I gave at a Tucson Cocoaheads meeting. This demo uses the Cocos2d graphics engine and Box2d physics engine to create an Angry Birds clone.

This is a simple, functioning game that was used to go over the basics of Cocos2d 1.0.1 and Box2d 2.1.2. It is mostly contained within HelloWorldLayer, the class by default added by Cocos2d. It goes over the basics of:

 * creating CCSprites and other display objects
 * connecting them to a physics world
 * using a b2ContactListener to deal damage to objects within the world
 * user input
 * and a few other details
